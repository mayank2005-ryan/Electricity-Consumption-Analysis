# 🔌 Electricity Consumption Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing electricity consumption patterns using a real-world dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights such as usage trends, regional differences, load patterns, and billing statistics.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `CDCF.csv`, which includes columns like:
- `Circle`
- `Division`
- `SubDivision`
- `Area`
- `Units`
- `Load`
- `Total Services`
- `Billed Services`
- `Category Description`
- `Month` (if available)

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze the relationship between **Load** and **Units Consumed**
2. Identify the **Top 10 Areas** with the highest electricity consumption
3. Compare **Billed Services** with **Total Services**
4. Analyze **Electricity Consumption by Circle**
5. Explore the **Distribution of Billed Services**
6. Visualize **Consumption by Consumer Category**
7. Understand the **Distribution of Electrical Load**
